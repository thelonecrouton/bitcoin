Older releases

<<<<<<< HEAD
Dash was previously known as Darkcoin.

Darkcoin tree 0.8.x was a fork of Litecoin tree 0.8, original name was XCoin
which was first released on Jan/18/2014.

Darkcoin tree 0.9.x was the open source implementation of masternodes based on
the 0.8.x tree and was first released on Mar/13/2014.

Darkcoin tree 0.10.x used to be the closed source implementation of Darksend
which was released open source on Sep/25/2014.

Dash Core tree 0.11.x was a fork of Bitcoin Core tree 0.9, Darkcoin was rebranded
to Dash.

These release are considered obsolete. Old changelogs can be found here:

- [v0.11.2](release-notes/dash/release-notes-0.11.2.md) released Mar/25/2015
- [v0.11.1](release-notes/dash/release-notes-0.11.1.md) released Feb/10/2015
- [v0.11.0](release-notes/dash/release-notes-0.11.0.md) released Jan/15/2015

=======
If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Crowncoin-Qt (on Mac) or
crowncoind/crowncoin-qt (on Linux).

Notable changes
================

Mining and relay policy enhancements
------------------------------------

Bitcoin Core's block templates are now for version 3 blocks only, and any mining
software relying on its `getblocktemplate` must be updated in parallel to use
libblkmaker either version 0.4.2 or any version from 0.5.1 onward.
If you are solo mining, this will affect you the moment you upgrade Bitcoin
Core, which must be done prior to BIP66 achieving its 951/1001 status.
If you are mining with the stratum mining protocol: this does not affect you.
If you are mining with the getblocktemplate protocol to a pool: this will affect
you at the pool operator's discretion, which must be no later than BIP66
achieving its 951/1001 status.

0.9.5 changelog
================

- `74f29c2` Check pindexBestForkBase for null
- `9cd1dd9` Fix priority calculation in CreateTransaction
- `6b4163b` Sanitize command strings before logging them.
- `3230b32` Raise version of created blocks, and enforce DERSIG in mempool
- `989d499` Backport of some of BIP66's tests
- `ab03660` Implement BIP 66 validation rules and switchover logic
- `8438074` build: fix dynamic boost check when --with-boost= is used
=======
If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run
0.9.0 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from 
30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine.

Downgrading warnings
--------------------

The 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous
releases, so if you run 0.9.x and then decide to switch back to a
0.8.x release you might get a blockchain validation error when starting the
old release (due to 'pruned outputs' being omitted from the index of
unspent transaction outputs).

Running the old release with the -reindex option will rebuild the chainstate
data structures and correct the problem.

Also, the first time you run a 0.8.x release on a 0.9 wallet it will rescan
the blockchain for missing spent coins, which will take a long time (tens
of minutes on a typical machine).

Important changes
==================

Gitian OSX build
-----------------

The deterministic build system that was already used for Windows and Linux
builds is now used for OSX as well. Although the resulting executables have
been tested quite a bit, there could be possible regressions. Be sure to report
these on the Github bug tracker mentioned above.

Compatibility of Linux build
-----------------------------

For Linux we now build against Qt 4.6, and filter the symbols for libstdc++ and glibc.
This brings back compatibility with

- Debian 6+ / Tails
- Ubuntu 10.04
- CentOS 6.5
